# teiModel
Please note that this model is not yet finished. We soon will release new very different ODD and RNG files. So consider the current files as forming a preliminary version.
The TEI model used by the platform for controlling the transcription and the authority files  
There is currently one model used for both tasks  
The model is provided under the form of a TEI ODD file, and a Relax NG schema file (XML syntax). Both include Schematron constraints.
Some HTML documentation is also provided (soon we will improve it ; it is generated with TEI Roma from the ODD file)
We also provide some XML/TEI example files: one containing the transcription of a will; and four other files (hree of them containing examples of authority records on persons, places and military units ; the last one contains the vocabulary that ca ,be used for analysing the content of the wills, as concerns the vision of death and the state of mind of the authors).
